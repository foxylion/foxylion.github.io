When evaluating a replacement for an existing tool, one of the things to concern
is loosing productivity. When switching from Eclipse to IntelliJ you'll miss
those embosomed shortcuts. Here is a summarization of shortcuts (with their
equivalent in IntelliJ) I use many times a day in Eclipse.

<!--more-->

| Description | Eclipse | IntelliJ IDEA |
| - | - | - |
| Open Class | ``Ctrl+Shift+T`` | ``Ctrl+N`` |
| Open Resource | ``Ctrl+Shift+R`` | ``Ctrl+Shift+N`` |
| Navigate Backward/Forward | ``Alt+Left/Right`` | ``Ctrl+Alt+Left/Right`` |
| Previous/Next Tab | ``Ctrl+Pg-Up/Pg-Down`` | ``Alt+Left/Right`` |
| Rename | ``Alt+Shift+R`` | ``Shift+F6`` |
| Quick-Fix | ``Ctrl+1`` | ``Alt+Enter`` |
| Optimize Imports | ``Ctrl+Shift+O`` | ``Ctrl+Alt+O`` ** |
| Find Usage | ``Ctrl+Shift+G`` | ``Alt+F7`` |
| Open Call Hierarchy | ``Ctrl+Alt+H`` | ``Ctrl+Alt+H`` |
| Open Declaration | ``F3`` | ``Ctrl+B`` |
| Show Type Hierarchy | ``Ctrl+T`` | ``Ctrl+H`` |
| Class Hierarchy Diagram |  | ``Ctrl+Alt+U`` & ``Return`` |
| Delete Line | ``Ctrl+D`` | ``Ctrl+Y`` |

** By default only removing unused imports, can be improved:<br>
``File`` ~ ``Settings`` ~ ``Editor`` ~ ``General`` ~ ``Auto Import`` ~ Check all boxes

I hope it helps you to quickly find the most common shortcuts of Eclipse in IntelliJ.
