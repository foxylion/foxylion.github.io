<p>While trawling the web I find regularly interesting articles which are worth to share.
Here you can find those articles I would recommend reading if you are interested in the topic.</p>

<p>I highly recommend to also read the hackernews comments if avaiable.
They most offently show different perspectives.
Nearly none of the articles is the one-and-only truth.</p>

<p>If a link does no longer work you can directly jump to Archive.org and get an archived version of the article.</p>
